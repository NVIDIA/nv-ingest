This is our teams code for https://github.com/NVIDIA/nv-ingest.

We have a few dataset options we test on: multimodal_test.pdf (3 page pdf), bo20 (20 pdfs), bo767 (767 pdfs), bo10k (10,000 pdfs), earnings_ingest, and more. If the datasets are not in f"/raid/{os.environ.get('USER', '')}/dataset-name/" then they can be located in /datasets on our server.

When starting to test in your agent environment, ALWAYS run source ~/setup_env.sh to have the proper environment.

Note that we are in a remote ssh box testing on an H100. I am a new software engineer on this project and prefer detailed explanations of changes.

If you ever need to start docker services, the base start for our repo is:

```
docker compose --profile retrieval --profile table-structure up --force-recreate --build -d
```

If you ever need to stop docker services, the base stop for our repo is:

```
docker compose --profile "*" down
docker compose --profile "*" rm --force
```
