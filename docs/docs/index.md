# Overview of NVIDIA NeMo Retriever

NVIDIA NeMo Retriever is a collection of microservices 
for building and scaling multimodal data extraction, embedding, and reranking pipelines 
with high accuracy and maximum data privacy – built with NVIDIA NIM.

NeMo Retriever provides the following:

- **Multimodal Data Extraction** — Quickly extract documents at scale that include text, tables, charts, and infographics.
- **Embedding + Indexing** — Embed all extracted text from text chunks and images, and then insert into Milvus - accelerated with NVIDIA cuVS.
- **Retrieval** — Leverage semantic + hybrid search for high accuracy retrieval with the embedding + reranking NIM microservice.

## Enterprise-Ready Features

NVIDIA NeMo Retriever comes with enterprise-ready features, including the following:

- **High Accuracy** — NeMo Retriever exhibits a high level of accuracy when retrieving across various modalities through enterprise documents. 
- **High Throughput** — NeMo Retriever is capable of extracting, embedding, indexing and retrieving across hundreds of thousands of documents at scale with high throughput. 
- **Decomposable/Customizable** — NeMo Retriever consists of modules that can be separately used and deployed in your own environment. 
- **Enterprise-Grade Security** — NeMo Retriever NIMs come with security features such as the use of [safetensors](https://huggingface.co/docs/safetensors/index), continuous patching of CVEs, and more.
