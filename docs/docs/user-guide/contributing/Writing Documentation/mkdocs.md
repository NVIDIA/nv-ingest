# MkDocs

## Build system

This uses [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) to build it's documentation.
Docstrings are converted to automatically-generated API reference pages using `mkdocstrings`, and can be linked from
markdown pages using [paths](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/usage/).
