# Developing with Kubernetes

Developing directly on Kubernetes gives us more confidence that end-user deployments will work as expected.

This page describes how to use Kubernetes generally and how to deploy nv-ingest on a local Kubernetes cluster.

> **NOTE:** _Unless otherwise noted, all commands below should be run from the root of this repo._

## Kubernetes Cluster

To start, you need a Kubernetes cluster. We recommend that you use `kind`, which creates a single Docker container with a Kubernetes cluster inside it.

Because the `kind` cluster needs access to the GPUs on your system, you need to install `nvkind`.
For details, see [Running kind clusters with GPUs using nvkind](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvkind/tree/main).
`nvkind` provides the following benefits:

- Multiple developers on the same system can have isolated Kubernetes clusters
- Easy to create and delete clusters

From the root of the repo, run the following code to create a configuration file for your cluster.

```yaml
{% raw %}
mkdir -p ./.tmp

cat <<EOF > ./.tmp/kind-config.yaml
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
name: nv-ingest-${USER}
nodes:
  - role: control-plane
    image: kindest/node:v1.29.2
  {{- range $gpu := until numGPUs }}
  - role: worker
    extraMounts:
      # We inject all NVIDIA GPUs using the nvidia-container-runtime.
      # This requires 'accept-nvidia-visible-devices-as-volume-mounts = true' be set
      # in '/etc/nvidia-container-runtime/config.toml'
      - hostPath: /dev/null
        containerPath: /var/run/nvidia-container-devices/{{ $gpu }}
  {{- end }}
EOF
{% endraw %}
```

Then, use the `nvkind` CLI to create your cluster.

```shell
nvkind cluster create \
    --config-template ./.tmp/kind-config.yaml
```

You should see output like this:

```shell
Creating cluster "jdyer" ...
 ✓ Ensuring node image (kindest/node:v1.27.11) 🖼
 ✓ Preparing nodes 📦
 ✓ Writing configuration 📜
 ✓ Starting control-plane 🕹️
 ✓ Installing CNI 🔌
 ✓ Installing StorageClass 💾
Set kubectl context to "kind-jdyer"
You can now use your cluster with:

kubectl cluster-info --context kind-jdyer

Have a nice day! 👋
```

You can list clusters on the system with `kind get clusters`.

```shell
kind get clusters
# jdyer
```

You can also just use `docker ps` to see the kind container.

```shell
docker ps | grep kind
# aaf5216a3cc8   kindest/node:v1.27.11  "/usr/local/bin/entr…"   44 seconds ago   Up 42 seconds 127.0.0.1:45099->6443/tcp jdyer-control-plane
```

`kind create cluster` does the following:

- Add a context for the cluster to `${HOME}/.kube/config`, the default config file used by tools like `kubectl`
- Change the default context to `${HOME}/.kube/config`

You should be able to use `kubectl` immediately, and it should be pointed at that cluster you just created.

For example, try listing notes to verify that the cluster was set up successfully.

```shell
kubectl get nodes
```

If that worked, you should see a single node like this:

```text
NAME                  STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
jdyer-control-plane   Ready    control-plane   63s   v1.27.11
```

Note: Not all of the containers created inside your Kubernetes cluster appear when you run `docker ps`
because some of them are are nested within a separate namespace.

For help with issues that arise, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).


## Skaffold

Now that you have a Kubernetes cluster, you can use [Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/) to build and deploy your development environment.

In a single command, Skaffold does the following:

- Build containers from the current directory (via `docker build`)
- Install the retriever-ingest helm charts (via `helm install`)
- Apply additional Kubernetes manifests (via `kustomize`)
- Hot reloading - Skaffold watches your local directory for changes and syncs them into the Kubernetes container
- Port forwards the ingest service to the host

### Directory Structure

- `skaffold/sensitive/` contains any secrets or manifests you want deployed to your cluster but not checked into git, as your local cluster is unlikely to have ESO installed. If it does, feel free to use `kind: ExternalSecret` instead.
- `skaffold/components` contains any k8s manifests you want deployed in any skaffold file. The paths are relative and can be used in either `kustomize` or `rawYaml` formats:

  ```yaml
  manifests:
    rawYaml:
      - sensitive/*.yaml
    kustomize:
      paths:
        - components/elasticsearch
  ```

- If adding a new service, try getting a helm object first. If none exists, you may have to encapsulate it with your k8s manifests in `skaffold/components`. We are a k8s shop, so manifest writing may be required from time to time.

### Prerequisites

#### Add Helm Repos

The retriever-ingest service's deployment requires pulling in configurations for other services from third-party sources,
such as Elasticsearch, OpenTelemetry, and Postgres.

The first time you deploy this project to a local Kubernetes,
you might need to tell your local version of `Helm` (a package manager for Kubernetes configurations)
where to find third-party services by running code similar to the following.

```shell
helm repo add \
  nvdp \
  https://nvidia.github.io/k8s-device-plugin

helm repo add \
  zipkin \
  https://zipkin.io/zipkin-helm

helm repo add \
  opentelemetry \
  https://open-telemetry.github.io/opentelemetry-helm-charts

helm repo add \
  nvidia \
  https://helm.ngc.nvidia.com/nvidia

helm repo add \
  bitnami \
  https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
```

For the full list of repositories, refer to the `dependencies` section in the [Chart.yaml](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nv-ingest/blob/main/helm/Chart.yaml) file.

#### NVIDIA GPU Support

For the Kubernetes pods to access the NVIDIA GPU resources, you must install the [NVIDIA device plugin for Kubernetes](https://github.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin).
There are many configurations for this plugin, but to start development simply run the following code.

```shell
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin/v0.15.0/deployments/static/nvidia-device-plugin.yml
```

#### Create an Image Pull Secret

You'll also need to provide a Kubernetes Secret with credentials to pull NVIDIA-private Docker images.

For short-lived development clusters, just use your own individual credentials.

```shell
DOCKER_CONFIG_JSON=$(
    cat "${HOME}/.docker/config.json" \
    | base64 -w 0
)

cat <<EOF > ./skaffold/sensitive/imagepull.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: nvcrimagepullsecret
type: kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
data:
  .dockerconfigjson: ${DOCKER_CONFIG_JSON}
EOF
```

You need an NGC personal API key to access models and images that are hosted on NGC.
First, [Generate an API key](ngc-api-key.md#generate-an-api-key).
Next, store the key in an environment variable by running the following code.

```shell
export NGC_API_KEY="<YOUR_KEY_HERE>"
```

Then, create the secret manifest with:

```shell
kubectl create secret generic ngcapisecrets \
  --from-literal=ngc_api_key="${NGC_API_KEY}" \
  --dry-run=client -o yaml \
  > skaffold/sensitive/ngcapi.yaml
```

### Deploy the Service

Run the following to deploy the retriever-ingest to your cluster.

```shell
skaffold dev \
    -v info \
    -f ./skaffold/nv-ingest.skaffold.yaml \
    --kube-context "kind-nv-ingest-${USER}"
```

<details><summary>explanation of those flags (click me)</summary>

- `-v info` = print INFO-level and above logs from `skaffold` and the tools it calls (like `helm` or `kustomize`)
- `-f ./skaffold/nv-ingest.skaffold.yaml` = use configuration specific to retriever-ingest
- `--tail=false` = don't flood your console with all the logs from the deployed containers
- `--kube-context "kind-${USER}"` = target the specific Kubernetes cluster you created with `kind` above

</details>

`skaffold dev` watches your local files and automatically redeploys the app as you change those files.
It also holds control in the terminal you run it in, and handles shutting down the pods in Kubernetes when you `Ctrl + C` out of it.

You should see output similar to this:

```shell
Generating tags...
 - ...
Checking cache...
 - ...
Tags used in deployment:
 - ...
Starting deploy...
Loading images into kind cluster nodes...
 - ...
Waiting for deployments to stabilize...
Deployments stabilized in 23.08 seconds
Watching for changes...
```

When you run this command, `skaffold dev` finds a random open port on the system and exposes the retriever-ingest service on that port.
For more information, see [Port Forwarding](https://skaffold.dev/docs/port-forwarding/).

You can find that port in `skaffold`'s logs by running the following code.

```bash
Port forwarding Service/nv-ingest in namespace , remote port http -> http://0.0.0.0:4503
```

Alternatively, you can obtain it like this:

```shell
NV_INGEST_MS_PORT=$(
    ps aux \
    | grep -E "kind\-${USER} port-forward .*Service/nv-ingest" \
    | grep -o -E '[0-9]+:http' \
    | cut -d ':' -f1
)
```

To confirm that the service is deployed and working, issue a request against the port you set up port-forwarding to above.

```shell
API_HOST="http://localhost:${NV_INGEST_MS_PORT}"

curl \
  -i \
  -X GET \
  "${API_HOST}/health"
```

When you run `skaffold verify` in a new terminal, Skaffold runs verification tests against the service.
These are very lightweight health checks, and should not be confused with integration tests.
For more information, see [Verify](https://skaffold.dev/docs/verify/).

## Clean Up

To destroy the entire Kubernetes cluster, run the following.

```shell
kind delete cluster \
    --name "${USER}"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Debugging Tools

`kubectl` is the official CLI for Kubernetes and supports a lot of useful functionality.

For example, to get a shell inside the `nv-ingest-ms-runtime` container in your deployment, run the following:

```shell
NV_INGEST_POD=$(
    kubectl get pods \
        --context "kind-${USER}" \
        --namespace default \
        -l 'app.kubernetes.io/instance=nv-ingest-ms-runtime' \
        --no-headers \
    | awk '{print $1}'
)
kubectl exec \
    --context "kind-${USER}" \
    --namespace default \
    pod/${NV_INGEST_POD} \
    -i \
    -t \
    -- sh
```

For an interactive, live-updating experience, try [k9s](https://k9scli.io/).
To launch it, run `k9s`.

```shell
k9s
```


### Installing Helm Repositories

You could encounter an error like the following.
This indicates that your local installation of `Helm` (a package manager for Kubernetes configurations)
doesn't know how to access a remote repository containing Kubernetes configurations.

```shell
Error: no repository definition for https://helm.dask.org. Please add the missing repos via 'helm repo add'
```

To resolve this issue, run `help repo add` with the URL and an informative name.

```shell
helm repo add \
    bitnami \
    https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
```

### Getting More Logs From `skaffold`

You could encounter an error like this:

```shell
Generating tags...
 - retrieval-ms -> retrieval-ms:f181a78-dirty
Checking cache...
 - retrieval-ms: Found Locally
Cleaning up...
 - No resources found
building helm dependencies: exit status 1
```

If you only see `building helm dependencies`, you probably ran `skaffold dev` or `skaffold run` in quiet mode.
Rerun the commands with `-v info` or `-v debug` to get more information about what failed.
