import warnings


# Suppressing CUDA-related warnings when running NV-Ingest on a CPU-only system.
#
# The warnings originate from Numba, which attempts to initialize CUDA even if no GPU is available.
# These warnings include errors about missing CUDA drivers or failing to dlopen `libcuda.so.1`.
#
# By temporarily ignoring `UserWarning` during the import, we prevent unnecessary clutter in logs
# while ensuring that cuDF still functions in CPU mode.
#
# Note: This does not affect cuDF behavior - it will still fall back to CPU execution if no GPU is detected.
