# Skaffold - Dev Team

Skaffold is intended to support the nv-ingest development team with kubernetes dev and testing. It is not meant to be used in production deployments or even for local testing.

We offer k8s support via Helm and those instructions can be found at [Helm Documentation](../helm/README.md)

For developers further documentation for using Skaffold can be found at [Skaffold Documentation](../docs/kubernetes-dev.md)
