# Skaffold - NV-Ingest Development Team Only


Skaffold is intended to support the NV-Ingest development team with Kubernetes development and testing. It is not meant to be used in production deployments nor for local testing.

We offer Kubernetes support through Helm and you can find those instructions at [Helm Documentation](../helm/README.md).

Development team members can find Skaffold documentation at [Skaffold Documentation](/docs/docs/extraction/kubernetes-dev.md).
